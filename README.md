# Browser Terminal

A terminal-like experience in browser UI.

## About

This used to be my old portfolio site to display my work. However, I realized not many hiring folks would find it very amusing to navigate around a terminal to know about me. So, I simplified my portfolio a bit and decided to move this code in here. It's not very re-usable but it looks cool, so why not ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
